# require 'fs'
- Make sure that I can read the parsed JSON file in the terminal. 
- Compile a list of all the users
- which set of data has a complete list of users? 
    Can users have orders but no payments? 
    Can users have payments but no orders?
    When finding users, push only unique users into the array, rather than filtering at the end.
- Write a function to get drink prices
- Write a function to get user order totals
- Write a funciton to get user payment totals
- make sure to float the dollar amounts to 2 decimal places.
    Do you want order_total, payment_total and balance to be Numbers?
- separate different logic into different pages
- npm init, add start command

After using Chat GPT, prompting it to help me refactor my code I was reminded of the following:
- Chat GPT makes mistakes. One of its first recommendations was to import something twice. It caused a crash and an error message that I quickly resolved. 
- The advantages of node is that it is non-blocking. It is therefore faster to wrap fs.readFile in a Promise to handle file reading asynchronously.
- I can use readFile instead of readFileSync. I don't need these json files read synchronously.
- .find() is better than .filter() in the getDrinkPrice function because I only need the first matching value.
- Any function dependencies should be included as arguments. This makes functions more versatile and bug proof.
